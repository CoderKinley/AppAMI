| Data Access Layer | Entity Framework, SQL Services | Database interaction and data persistence |
| Integration Layer | REST APIs, MQTT Broker, DLMS/COSEM Protocols | Communication with meters and external systems |
| Infrastructure | Cloud/On-premises Hybrid | Flexible deployment options to meet requirements |

## Communication Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Benefits |
|----------|---------|----------|
| MQTT | Real-time meter data transmission | Low bandwidth usage, ideal for remote areas with limited connectivity |
| RESTful API | System integration and data exchange | Standard interface for enterprise system integration |
| DLMS/COSEM | Meter communication standard | Industry standard protocol for meter data collection |
| TLS/SSL | Secure communications | End-to-end encryption of sensitive data |

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 4-core processor | 8+ core processor |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| Storage | 500 GB SSD | 1+ TB SSD |
| Network | 10 Mbps dedicated | 100+ Mbps dedicated |
| OS | Windows 10 Pro | Windows Server 2019+ |

## Deployment Topology

OmniAMI can be deployed in various configurations depending on the operational requirements:

| Deployment Model | Description | Best For |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| Centralized | Single installation at headquarters | Small-scale deployments |
| Distributed | Regional installations with central sync | Large geographic areas |
| High-Availability | Redundant installations with failover | Critical infrastructure |
| Cloud-Hybrid | Cloud processing with on-premises data collection | Optimizing IT resources |

## MQTT Implementation

OmniAMI leverages MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for efficient, reliable communication with meters across Bhutan's diverse geography:

- **Publish/Subscribe Model**: Enables efficient one-to-many message distribution
- **Quality of Service Levels**: Ensures message delivery even in unreliable network conditions
- **Last Will and Testament**: Provides notification when meters disconnect unexpectedly
- **Retained Messages**: Maintains state information for newly connected clients
- **Lightweight Protocol**: Minimizes bandwidth usage in remote areas with limited connectivity
- **Broker Architecture**: Centralized message handling with distributed client connections

The MQTT implementation is particularly valuable for Bhutan's challenging terrain, where traditional communication methods may be unreliable. This protocol allows OmniAMI to maintain connections with meters in remote mountainous regions while minimizing data transmission costs.

## Implementation Benefits

- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduction in manual meter reading requirements by over 95%
- **Data Accuracy**: Elimination of manual data entry errors
- **Network Visibility**: Comprehensive view of the entire distribution network
- **Outage Response**: Decreased outage response time from hours to minutes
- **Load Management**: Better load balancing and capacity planning
- **Loss Reduction**: Identification of technical and non-technical losses
- **Asset Management**: Improved transformer lifecycle management
- **Cost Savings**: Significant reduction in operational expenses

## Integration Points

AMI seamlessly integrates with various enterprise systems:

- **Billing Systems**: For automatic consumption data transfer
